-- Third Person prototype Godot 3.4 --

This is an open source Third Person prototype using Godot 3.4 to better understand Godot 3D and third person character controllers as a whole, as they are kind of a niche in the Godot Engine space.

Everybody willing to contribute to this project is free to! If you want to add or improve something be my guest.

We will not be making any profit off of this prototype. It can be used as a base for myself and others to make their own third person action games using Godot, provided you use your own assets.
